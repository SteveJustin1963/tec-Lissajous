## 3 use FAST FOURIER TRANSFORM to make a audio more clear and free from distortion 
mathematical steps
1. Convert the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain using the Fourier transform. 
2. Identify the frequencies that are causing distortion.  
3. Apply a filter to remove the distortion-causing frequencies.  
4. Convert the signal back to the time domain using the inverse Fourier transform.
